# 3D Printer

Well, the topic is huge. We can start by categorizing based on technology, proprietary vs open source/open hardware and so on.

There are many ways to make physical things by "printing", See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing#Processes.

I will focus on SLA (Sterelitography) and FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) which seems to be the most common avaiable for less than a few thousand dollars.
